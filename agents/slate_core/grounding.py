"""Evidence-linked grounding for LLM drafts. Heuristic, fail-closed on citations.

The idea: the model is asked to tag every content line with the source block(s)
it draws from, and this module then checks those claims mechanically.

What it catches:
- lines with no source citation at all (fail closed)
- citations pointing at source blocks that do not exist
- numbers in the draft that do not appear in the cited sources
- capitalized names (employers, institutes, products) that do not appear in the
  cited sources
- lines whose content words mostly do not appear in the cited sources
  (prefix-matched, so "internship" matches "Intern")

What it still CANNOT catch (be honest about this):
- qualifier inflation on a sourced term ("advanced Excel" when "Excel" is sourced)
- paraphrase-level exaggeration that keeps sourced words
- a line that cites a real block but twists its meaning
- heavy but legitimate rewording can false-flag; that is why the human review
  step is structural and these violations block approval, not generation.
A pass means "every line cites sources and stays within them mechanically",
never "true".
